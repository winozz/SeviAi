"""Canonical campus place data for the CvSU Don Severino delas Alas Campus (Indang).

Single source of truth for the chatbot's map feature. Both `app.py` (root) and
`api/app.py` import from this module so the 48 locations from the official
campus map (Matayuyon Crop Science Society, 2026) stay in lockstep across
entry points.

Pixel coordinates (x, y) are in the campus image's 2000 x 2000 reference frame
and match `SeviWeb/app/lib/campusMap.ts`. Keep the two files in sync when
moving markers.
